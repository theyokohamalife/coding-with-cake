# Exercise #1

Let's update the HTML to make it a bit more personal!

1. Change the heading in `index.html` from "Coding with Cake" to your own unique phrase.

2. Drag a (family appropriate) picture to the `assets` directory. Find the `img` tag in `index.html` and change the path to match the name of the picture you just copied.

3. Replace the text in the `span` tag that says "What is this all about?" with a short description about your picture.

# Exercise #2

Let's practice running code in our HTML file!

1. Create a button that says "Click me!"

2. Set the button type to "button"

   - You can read more about button types [here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_button_type.asp).

3. Add an `on-click` attribute to the button to console.log a message.

# Exercise #3

Let's try manipulating the DOM!

1. Change the `on-click` attribute on the button to a queryselector for the `h1` tag.

   - Learn about query selectors [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector).

2. Set the value of the `innerHTML` of the `h1` tag to the name of your favorite kind of cake.

3. Press the button and see what happens!

# Exercise #4

Lastly, let's load JavaScript from another file into `index.html`
